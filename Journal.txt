Beginnings inspired by the current running 'Sajam Slam' competition and my love of fighting games I was inspired to make a project that incorporates this and tech functionality. I wanted to make a fight pad as a lifetime controller/pad play I was starting to find issues with execution but I could find any form fitting to me as I am left handed I also wanted to create a tool with wider functionality like also being able to play Tetris thus...

Quarter circle quandary was born

I started the project creating a schematic for my PCB then used a physical drawing of how my hand laid on a piece of paper to get ideas for the measurements of the frame as this was nee to me a lot of time was spent creating and reworking the PCB to make it both ergonomic and functional

Build a frame around the PCB wasn't too bad in retrospect but outdated drivers made the initial use of fusion 360 impossible but once resolved all was well

The Biggest roadblock of the project was creating the lid for the project due to the 'ergonomic' placement of the key it was near impossible to model on keyboard-layout-editor and I did not know this thus after many hours of tinkering I realised the best method was importing the model of the PCB and using the holes for buttons to make coincident squares that the keyhole cold be mapped to

When creating the firmware I look around for multiple examples of what could be done and upon the realisation that I wanted access to all keys I need key chording a new feature of kmk in order to switch between layers and am likely in implement more layers with further use
