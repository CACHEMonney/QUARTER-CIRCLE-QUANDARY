# 27/06/25 PLANNING

[Beginnings inspired by the current running 'Sajam Slam' competition and my love of fighting games I was inspired to make a project that incorporates this and tech functionality. I wanted to make a fight pad as a lifetime controller/pad play I was starting to find issues with execution but I could find any form fitting to me as I am left handed I also wanted to create a tool with wider functionality like also being able to play Tetris thus...]

# 27/06/25 PCB

[I started the project creating a schematic for my PCB using the hackpad tutorial]

[Then used a physical drawing of how my hand laid on a piece of paper to get ideas for the measurements of the frame as this was new to me a lot of time was spent creating and reworking the PCB to make it both ergonomic and functional]

[after finishing the the design i became intrested in aethetics and learnt how to add images to a PCB by creating a pretty library i only ended up watching half of the tutorial and accident started by importing it a symbol library]

# 28/06/25 Frame + Troubleshooting 

[Builing a frame around the PCB wasn't too bad in retrospect but outdated drivers made the initial use of fusion 360 impossible but after a few hours of troubleshooting and reboots but once resolved all was well.]

# 29/06/25 Lid 

[The Biggest roadblock of the project was creating the lid for the project due to the 'ergonomic' placement of the key it was near impossible to model on keyboard-layout-editor and I did not know this thus after many hours of tinkering I realised the best method was importing the model of the PCB and using the holes for buttons to make coincident squares that the keyhole could be mapped to.]

[The main problem i was finding in keyboard-layout-editor was that the size and distances between increments of movement did not go to a high enough resolution to match that of my project so i kept getting things that were kinda close but not really usable]

# 29/06/25 Firmware

[When creating the firmware I look around for multiple examples of what could be done and upon the realisation that I wanted access to all keys I need key chording a new feature of kmk in order to switch between layers and am likely in implement more layers with further use cases due to the feature being new there was little info on it and itll probably need a lot of tinkering.]
